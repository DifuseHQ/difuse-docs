## Static Leases

Creating a static lease is trivial all you need to do is click on the “Add” button and fill out the form:

<a data-fancybox data-src="./img/3.png" data-caption="Network Settings - DNS & DHCP - Static Leases">
  <img src="./img/3.png" />
</a>


```admonish info
If there are no IPv6 leases that the DHCP server gives out, the DUID input will be greyed out and you don’t have to specify anything in the IPv6 suffix section.
```

Once you add the static lease, it’ll look like this in the table:
